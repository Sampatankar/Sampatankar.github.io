This is my personal website.

All professional work is linked on sites that specialise on specific things
- Github for my code
- LinkedIn for contact and biography/skills
- Google Scholar for my publication record
- Medium for articles that I'm happy to publish.

My personal site is a agglomeration site and a place where I can organically express myself.  Therefore....new work soon.
